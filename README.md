# Emotion Recognition using Machine Learning

## Overview
Welcome to the **Emotion Recognition using Machine Learning** repository! This project aims to develop a robust and accurate emotion recognition system leveraging the power of machine learning. By analyzing facial expressions, we can classify and understand human emotions, enabling numerous applications in fields such as human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, customer service, and more.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: Implemented Random Forest machine learning model for the Feature
- **Real-Time Processing**: Enable real-time emotion recognition through optimized algorithm and efficient data processing techniques.
- **Customizable and Extensible**: Easily adapt and extend the system for specific use cases and additional emotion categories.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface for easy interaction and visualization of detected emotions.
